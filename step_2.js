// Assign two variables to values 5 and 6. Write code logic that will swap values in 
// these two variables. (without using number 5 and 6 again)

// Assign a variable to a value of 12. Write code that will multiply the value of this variable by 5
// and store the result back in the same variable.

// Use two variables. Write code that three times checks if these two variables are equal.
// Results of these checks must be in this order - true, false, true. Each variable can be 
// assigned at most 2 times.

// U Const poglavlju pise ovo "It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant 
// reference to a value.". Jel razumijs kaj to znaci? Kaj je referenca, a kaj je value?

// Assign one variable as "37" and other as "7". both string. Compare them with > or < and 
// write it with console log.

// Assigne three variables to 0, 10 and undefined. On all three apply operator that check if 
// variable is undefined if it is value is assgned.

// Declare a variable x outside of a block and assign it a value of 12. 
// Also declare a global variable y=20. Inside the block, declare another variable x with
// a value of 5. In that block add new block and assign x to 3. In that block create new
// block and assign x to 3 and y to 50. Print (console.log) both variables inside each scope that exists. 
// Try to understand the output.

// Declare and assigne variables x and y. Izračunaj potenciju x na y i spremi u varijablu z.
// Do it all with just 2 lines of code.

// Assign a variable `a` to 15, `b` to undefined, and `c` to 25. 
// Write code that checks if `b` is undefined. If so, assign it the value of `a`.
// Then, write a check to see if `c` is undefined, and if so, assign it the value of `b`.
// Print all the values at the end.
