// Declare variables x and y in two lines of code (two statments)

// Declare variables x and y in one line of code (one statement)

// Declare variables x and y and then assign values 5 and 6 to these variables

// Declare a variable x. Assign value 5 to variable x and then reassigne it to value 10

// Declare and assign variable x whose value can not be changed

// Declare and assign variable x whose datatype will be string

// Create variable whose value is undefined

// Assign value 5 to variable x. Then assign value of x to variable y

// Use any arithmetic operators in assignement statement

// Create two variables, both with value 5. You can use number 5 only once to do so.

// Declare and assign two variables and them multiply them and store the result in third variable.

// Write symbols of four arithmetic operators to console

// Write to console example of single character that can not be on the first place of variable name

// Create variables xx, XX and x-x. Assgin three different values to them and write each to console

// Declare variables x, y and z. Assign value 11 to variable z without ever using number 1 in code.
